<li>In a large bow,l add flour and make a well then add sugar, salt.</li>
<li>Add water, and ghee or oil. Knead to form soft and sticky dough.</li>
<li>Place dough on a heavily floured board and knead for about 3-4minutes. Continue to flour dough as needed to facilitate kneading. Be careful not to overdo it. Dough should be soft, elastic and smooth.</li>
<li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, form the dough into 16 balls.</li>
<li>Wrap the dough balls in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
<li>Remove dough balls from fridge the next day making sure to bring them to room temperature before proceeding.</li>
<li>Start making the filling while the dough balls come up to room temperature.</li>
<li>Place the potatoes into a pan of water and boil them until they are cooked through. Drain out the water and then roughly mash them - leave somewhat chunky. Set aside.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a pan. Add the mustard seeds and fry for 10 seconds until they start to pop. Add the onions and ginger and stir-fry for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Add the chicken and brown on a medium heat for a few minutes. Add the water and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
<li>Then, take a potato masher and mash the chicken. (or use a food processor)</li>
<li>Add the peas and smashed potatoes - Mix well</li>
<li>Add all of the spices, the salt and the fresh coriander. Mix well</li>
<li>Cover and steam on low heat for a few minutes until the peas are cooked. Allow to cool completely before using to fill samosas.</li>
<li>To make the Samosas:</li>
<li>Roll the dough using a lightly floured rolling pin; cut it half. Spoon a generous 1-2 tablespoons filling in the center of a half-circle; lightly moisten the dough edges with water or flour paste, using your finger. Fold the end over the filling to form a triangle, and then continue to fold up the strip in triangles, like you would a flag. Continue with remaining dough. Set samosas on tray.</li>
<li>In a large sauce pan, pour vegetable oil, until it is at least 3 inches, and place on medium heat or until oil is 350 degrees.</li>
<li>When ready, gently place a few samosas at a time into the saucepan.</li>
<li>Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is light brown.</li>
<li>Turn over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is light brown.</li>
<li>If baking, place on a baking sheet and brush with canola oil. Then bake at 375 degrees F for about 20 minutes or more until golden brown, turning once.</li>
<li>Serve warm or at room temperature with ranch dressing, raita, (mango) chutney, or tamarind sauce.</li>
