recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter  1 stick  at room temperature  no subsitute for best tesults "
- "1/4 cup shortening such as crisco brand  no substitute for best results "
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/3 light brown sigar packed"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/4 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips"
- "10 scoops of ice cream of choice"

- " whipped cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large  bowl, beat butter, shortening and both sugars until light and fluffy, add egg and vanilla and beat in."
- "Combine flour with baking powder and salt in medium bowl, whisk to combine."
- "Add flour mixture to butter / sugar mixture and mix just until blended. Fold in chocolate chips."
- "Divide dough into 10 balls. Place on parchment lined platter and refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 to 3 hours."
- "Have ready regular standard cupcake tins. Turn cupcake tins upside down. Cover every other cupcake tin bottom with foil  liners, or cut foil to fit over bottom smoothly. Spray foil liners with non stick spray."
- "Preheat oven to 350"
- "Remove balls of dough from refrigerator and roll two  at a time between two sheets of parchment paper, to about 1/8 inch thick. Keep dough cold while rolling each group."
- "Peel dough carefully from parchment paper and drape over foil coverered tin. With floured hands, to prevent sticking,  mold dough onto tin, trim bottom and fill any cracks."

- "Fill each cooled cup with a small scoop of ice cream, top with whipped cream and sprinkles. Or fill with any of your own creations!"
- "I filled these with ice cream, but there are endless possibility&#39;s. Fill with fruit, yogurt, pudding, candy,  nuts,  moouses trail mix,  or anything you can think of!  Keep in mind if filling with wet ingredients to fill close to serving time as the cookies will soften if left to long."
