recipeingredient:
- " Equipment"
- "1 big ziploc bag"
- " Immersion blender or food processor"
- " Bbq or campfire"
- " Chicken"
- "6 boneless chicken thigs"
- " Curry Paste"
- "3 tbsp cooking oil"
- "1 clove garlic chopped"
- "1/4 onion chopped"
- "1 tbsp or more of turmeric powder"
- " Yoghurt  Mixture"
- "2 cups yoghurt"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "3 cloves garlic chopped"
- "1/2 onion chopped"
- "3 inches ginger root chopped"
- "1 The cooled curry paste you made in step"
- " Red Ingredients"
- "2-10 red scotch bonnet peppers chopped"
- "2-10 red chilli peppers chopped"
- "2  tbsp paprika powder"
- "2  drops of red food color"
- " Chilli flakes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the curry paste by heating oil on medium heat in a small pan, and adding the Curry Paste ingredients. As it heats up, stir it so everything gets covered in yellow, and let it cook for 2-3 mins until the onions and garlic are soft. Remove from heat, transfer to a bowl and cool in the freezer. It should be really dark yellow, and doesn’t taste good... but it smells like curry!"
- "Make the Yoghurt Mixture by putting the Yoghurt Mixture Ingredients and the cooled Curry Paste in the blender. Blend it until it’s smooth. It should look like yellow yoghurt. It should taste extremely intense. You’re going to lose a lot of flavour as it transfers to the chicken, so make it stronger by adding more of any of the Yoghurt Mixture ingredients, except more yoghurt. Leave it in the blender."
- "Make it Red, by adding the red ingredients to the Yoghurt Mixture, in the blender. Start small.. add a couple peppers, a couple drops of juice or dye, and/or a bit of paprika, and blend it up, and see how it looks/tastes. Repeat this over and over, noticing how it’s going from yellow to orange to dark orange, to red. Wow - it really does take a lot to make it red! You don’t need to take it all the way to red, just remember that there will be a substantial flavour/spice loss, so more is okay."
- "Chop the chicken thighs into 3 (or don’t) and place them in the bag. Now pour Red Yoghurt Mixture over the chicken. Close the ziploc bag, squeezing out all the air as you do it. Air bubbles = baad. Once it’s closed, massage the Red Yoghurt Mixture into the chicken for a minute or so, making sure every bit of the chicken is coated. It should look like a package of marinating chicken that you might buy somewhere."
- "Put the bag of chicken in the fridge. Each day, make sure the seal on the bag is still good, then -without opening the bag- move the chicken pieces around and massage again, making sure that flavour is going to make it into every possible bite, from every possible angle. For optimal results, wait about 4 days."
- "When you want some, heat up the bbq and put some on the grill. Wait until the girls is hot enough to hear a sizzle sound when you put the chicken on the grill. You can cook it on high (500+ degrees) for a short amount of time (about 3 mins per side) or on low (200 degrees) for a long amount of time (10-15 mins per side)."
- "Eat... finally"
